    "\n",
    "Executive Summary:\n",
    "On April 4, 2025, the security operations center (SOC) was alerted to anomalous behavior originating from an engineering jump box (ENG-JB01). The incident spanned approximately 18 hours and resulted in the compromise of multiple internal systems, theft of sensitive source code repositories, and signs of attempted exfiltration to a known threat infrastructure host associated with APT29. This report outlines the timeline, impact, attacker techniques, and remediation actions taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timeline of Events:\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 01:14 UTC: Alert triggered for unusual lateral movement attempt originating from ENG-JB01. Logged by Cisco XDR as \\\"Possible Pass-the-Hash movement attempt.\\\"\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 01:18 UTC: Multiple failed Kerberos authentication attempts on host HR-LAPTOP-5 from ENG-JB01.\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 01:23 UTC: Successful logon to FIN-SQL-02 using a privileged service account (svc-backup-prod) outside of usual login times.\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 01:25 UTC: PowerShell execution detected from FIN-SQL-02 running a Base64-encoded command fetching content from hxxp://185.44.76.100/payload.ps1.\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 01:30 UTC: Scheduled task created named \\\"WindowsHealth\\\" on FIN-SQL-02 for persistence.\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 01:33 UTC: Internal network scanning activity detected from FIN-SQL-02 targeting subnet 10.0.42.0/24.\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 02:01 UTC: SMB and WMI-based authentication attempts observed toward code repository server (ENG-GIT-SRV).\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 02:11 UTC: Access to sensitive Git repositories verified using server audit logs.\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 02:15–04:30 UTC: Multiple 50–150MB file transfers from ENG-GIT-SRV to ENG-JB01. Total volume approx. 3.1GB.\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 04:45 UTC: Outbound connection to 185.44.76.100 established from ENG-JB01 on port 443, observed via egress firewall logs.\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 04:52 UTC: Data transfer spike of ~3.2GB to external host.\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 05:02 UTC: DLP system flagged unauthorized data exfiltration attempt. Incident escalated to IR team.\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 05:13 UTC: Isolation actions initiated on ENG-JB01, FIN-SQL-02, and ENG-GIT-SRV.\n",
    "- 2025-04-04 05:55 UTC: Memory capture and forensic triage initiated on all impacted systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tactics and Techniques:\n",
    "- Initial Access: Credential stuffing or lateral movement via Jump Box (ENG-JB01)\n",
    "- Credential Access: Possible Pass-the-Hash (T1550.002), credential dumping via LSASS access\n",
    "- Execution: Obfuscated PowerShell scripts (T1059.001)\n",
    "- Persistence: Scheduled Task creation (T1053.005)\n",
    "- Discovery: Network scanning (T1046)\n",
    "- Collection: Staging of large volumes of code repositories\n",
    "- Exfiltration: HTTPS outbound to threat infrastructure (T1041)\n",
    "\n",
    "Impacted Assets:\n",
    "- ENG-JB01 (Jump Box, staging point)\n",
    "- FIN-SQL-02 (Finance DB server, used for lateral movement)\n",
    "- ENG-GIT-SRV (Code repository server, source of exfiltrated data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Impacted Data:\n",
    "- At least 12 private Git repositories accessed\n",
    "- Two contained proprietary ML models and customer integration code\n",
    "- No indication of PII or PCI data exposure\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Cause:\n",
    "The attacker appears to have compromised or reused valid credentials on ENG-JB01, which had elevated network permissions. The exact credential acquisition method is undetermined but likely due to reuse or prior phishing compromise. MFA was not enabled on the jump box account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remediation Actions:\n",
    "- Immediate network isolation of all affected systems\n",
    "- Reset of all privileged and domain service accounts\n",
    "- Implementation of LAPS and forced password rotation for local accounts\n",
    "- Blocking outbound traffic to 185.44.76.100 at the firewall\n",
    "- Deployment of EDR response rules for persistence techniques\n",
    "- Initiated rollout of MFA to all bastion and admin systems\n",
    "- Engaged law enforcement and threat intelligence partners for IOCs\n",
    "\n",
    "Lessons Learned:\n",
    "- MFA gaps on high-privilege infrastructure allowed credential reuse\n",
    "- Scheduled task creation alerts were not being monitored\n",
    "- EDR rules for base64-encoded PowerShell were disabled in engineering OU\n",
    "- Repository audit logging was insufficient to detect staging early\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "- Mandatory MFA on all privileged and remote-access accounts\n",
    "- Enable audit logging on all code and data staging systems\n",
    "- Expand scheduled task alerting across all domains\n",
    "- Conduct purple team simulation to test lateral movement detection\n",
