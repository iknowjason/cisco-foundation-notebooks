    "\n",
    "1. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure all activities comply with local and international laws\n",
    "2. **Authorized Testing**: Only use findings for authorized penetration tests and security assessments\n",
    "3. **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through proper channels\n",
    "4. **Privacy Respect**: Avoid targeting specific individuals mentioned in job postings\n",
    "5. **Professional Ethics**: Use intelligence for defensive purposes and organizational improvement\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Process multiple job descriptions efficiently\n",
    "- **Cost Management**: Pay only for analysis time, no idle infrastructure costs\n",
    "- **Security**: Leverage AWS security controls and compliance frameworks\n",
    "- **Collaboration**: Easy sharing of endpoints across security teams\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Managed infrastructure with high availability\n",
