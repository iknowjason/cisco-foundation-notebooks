    "\n",
    "Security teams often write detection rules or response playbooks (e.g., for SIEMs, SOAR platforms, or XDRs) but struggle to systematically map them to the right MITRE ATT&CK techniques. This limits the organization's visibility into detection coverage and hinders frameworks like D3FEND, ATT&CK Navigator, and threat-informed defense.\n",
